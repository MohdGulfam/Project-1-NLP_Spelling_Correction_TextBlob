# Project-1_Spelling_Correction_NLP_TextBlob
spelling correction and spell checking is a well-known and well-studied problem in natural language processing.Correcting spelling mistakes is an integral part of writing in the modern world, whether it is part of texting a phone, sending an email, writing large documents or searching for information on the web.With the use of textblob library in Python, we can easily create NLP Models for the task of Spelling Corrections. Detecting actual word spelling errors is a much more difficult task, as any word in the input text can be an error. 

However, it is possible to use the noisy channel to find candidates for every word the user typed and rank the correction that was probably the userâ€™s original intention.
